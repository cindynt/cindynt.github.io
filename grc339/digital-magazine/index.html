                                    The shoegaze giants return after 6 years with their fifth album <span class="italic">everything is alive</span>. Since forming over three decades ago, this album reflects on those years together as a band (and apart) in a hopeful blend of wispy and shimmering melodies.

                                <p>
                                    It’s been a long time since shoegaze has felt as invigorated as it does right now. But before examining the riveting state of the present-day shoegaze landscape, it’s important to revisit what happened to the genre throughout the 2010s, a decade of myriad incremental innovations but few radical transformations.

                                <h3>Celebrating the 30th anniversary of Cocteau Twins' album 'Four-Calendar Cafe'</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Released on October 18, 1993, Cocteau Twins' seventh studio album manifests maturity and fragility in equal measure. Complete with a memorable design of inanimate objects by the <span class="italic">I Spy</span> children’s book creator Walter Wick, <span class="italic">Four-Calendar Café</span> still stands tall going into its fourth decade.

                                    Beach House didn’t invent dream pop, but their influence on the sound transformed '80s shoegaze into an art form of its own.

                                    It may sound obscure and distorted. It may even freak you out. This freaky, ethereal mixture of alt-rock and indie is called 'shoegaze.'

                                    The Jesus and Mary Chain’s Jim Reid talks about his long-running battle with stage fright, being a latecomer to jazz, getting along with his brother and what the future might hold. In the works: a book, a documentary and a new album.

                                    The meme-driven stereotype may depict ex-punks or ex-whatevers falling back into something nostalgic and time-honored, but this crop of heavy shoegazers are doing just the opposite: falling into the genre almost by mistake and then reshaping it in their image.
